# Facial-emotion-Recognition
This repo contains the code which does Facial Recognition using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms on FER2013 Dataset.

It depicts the performance of a set of 5 machine learning
(ML) and deep learning (DL) models, CNN, GNB, kNN, MLP,
mini-batch k-Means with PCA, run on FER2013 benchmark
dataset and includes the inferences drawn from it for Facial
Emotion classification. The FER2013 dataset is a labeled dataset
for headshots depicting emotions in seven classes (happy, sad,
angry, afraid, surprise, disgust, and neutral). The ML and DL
models chosen above are used to determine the best possible model
for FER. Using the test dataset of FER2013, we were able to obtain
an accuracy score of 61.27% accuracy using CNN, 25% using
MLP, 30% from mini-batch k-means, 23% from GNB and 51%
using kNN classification algorithms. Performance metrics,
hyperparameters and other heuristic methods are tuned to try
improving accuracy, and conclusions are drawn from the
performance of the models.
